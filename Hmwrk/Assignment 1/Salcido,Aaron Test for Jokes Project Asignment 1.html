<!--- Test for jokes --->

<script>
var joke = "Javascript walked into a bar....";
<!--- toldJoke stays false...how do we allow it to change its Bool value to true? --->
var toldJoke = "false";
var $punchLine =
	"Better watch out for those semi-colons.";
<!--- I removed the "%" from var entage because DW was returning an error because of it. This might be causing an error, see below comment. --->
 var entage = 20;
 var result
 
 
 if (toldJoke == true) <!--- How do we prove this...? --->
 	{
    	Alert($punchLine) ;
	} else  {
 	alert(joke);
 }
 </script>
 <!--- I Added the "{" after Else because dreamweaver was telling me that the code was broken there, which fixed it <br>
 for the most part but the prompt doesn't finish the punchline because there is no way to make prove (toldJoke == true) 
 --->
